# MyStore E-Commerce site

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The app will demonstrate a basic cart management system, as well as a simple method of handling user authentication using forms.
- Users will be able to have items to add to cart
- Users can add goods to the favorites to buy later
- Users will be able to filter through the products to find different products
- Users can filter further using the search bar
- Users can add and remove products from the cart,
- Users will be able to checkout and get a thanks message from purchase store
- I will also try implementing a Stripe checkout for purchases

- The app uses useReduce and Context to achieve most of these
